# LidStatusService

LidStatusService is a Windows service to run a command when the laptop lid opens or closes.

This is a fork of [rowandh/lidstatusservice](https://github.com/rowandh/lidstatusservice)
(see also [its README](UPSTREAM-README.md)).

## TODO

- Stopping service should stop service
- Convert to 64-bit
